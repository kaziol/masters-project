#Code used for masters degree thesis calculations.

##Its main goal was to calculated tortuous parameter of investigated porous media.

Depth First Search, modified Dijkstra algorithm were used for estimating fluid's flow-path through porous media.
Bezier curve calculation allowed to obtain more natural curvature of generated paths. 
The above calculations allowed to calculate investigated media tortuous.

##Average pore dimensions

Also average pore volume was determined using checking pore dimension at random coordinates. 
Using relative number of samples, it allows to assume average pore dimensions.
